Package: cominit
Architecture: any
Depends:
 ${shlibs:Depends},
 ${misc:Depends},
Description: Initramfs tool to verify and mount the real rootfs from storage
 The resulting binary (cominit) expects to be run as the system init process
 out of an initramfs. Its purpose is to mount the rootfs partition, switch the
 root and start the rootfs init. The rootfs filesystem may be read-only or
 read-write using any filesystem supported by the Kernel in use. Continuous
 integrity checking is supported through dm-verity for read-only and
 dm-integrity for writable variants.
 .
 If successful, cominitwill clean up after itself and exec into the rootfs
 init ([rootfs]/sbin/init). On any fatal error, cominit will try to exec into
 a rescue shell. This will be either [initramfs]/bin/sh if the error occured
 before switching the root or [rootfs]/bin/sh if it occured after.
